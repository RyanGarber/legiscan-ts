/*
Sample code: multiquery merging

Getting all bills around a topic based on keywords may involve running
multiple queries. This code performs repeated searches for keywords in a
larger query, de-deduplicates them based on the Legiscan ID, and then outputs
the final result to a JSON file for processing.
